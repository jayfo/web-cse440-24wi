## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

    Navigating diverse work schedules and lifestyles among friends/family, including students,
    full-time workers, parents, and those balancing multiple roles, poses a challenge in finding
    time to connect over movies. Despite the desire to share this experience, the limited time
    available often results in gaps in movie recall, prompting the need to spend valuable
    conversation time looking up details or feigning familiarity. To enhance the
    movie-discussion experience, there's a shared aspiration to streamline this process and
    create a space that accommodates diverse schedules, fostering meaningful connections without
    sacrificing the enjoyment of shared cinematic experiences.

    Our innovative design seamlessly integrates smartphones and smartwatches, accommodating both
    home and theater environments. Users can record notes vocally, initiated by holding the
    screen on the watch, which are then transcribed and editable via a connected app,
    facilitating concise conversation references.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

Our goal was to discover how individuals keep track of their thoughts during/after watching
a film, as well as the resulting gaps that appear when two people try to connect
asynchronously over movies afterwards. It was important to find which aspects of this
process are actually difficult, and how users might realistically want to record their
thoughts during a movie.

We performed our research by interviewing both avid and casual movie fans, as well as
interviewing and conducting fly-on-the-wall observations with a couple in a long distance
relationship that discussed a movie virtually after watching it asynchronously. We chose
these participants to gain an understanding of common problems faced between avid and casual
fans, and the couple to observe two people that regularly and asynchronously connect over
media. The purpose of conducting a fly-on-the-wall observation for the couple was to allow
us to directly observe behaviors they might not otherwise report in a Q&A interview giving
us deeper insight into how they accomplished tasks.



### Movie-Watchers Value Recall!

{/* maxHeight={"400px"} */}
<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: textimage3,
        alt: "Screen from ReelTalk showing placeholders for notes transcribed"
    }}
    caption={
        "Screen from ReelTalk showing placeholders for notes transcribed."
    }
    width={4}
>
    All participants ended up trying to remember how they felt during memorable moments in
    post-movie discussions. Specifically, this took the form of the participants in the couple
    creating statements like “When Barbie cried, I cried. Did you feel that?” Then the other
    participant would then respond with how they remembered that moment, or in this case more
    interestingly, “When was that again?” Or similarly, moments like “What was that song I
    liked again?” This often led to Googling, debate, or skipping over these moments in
    discussion entirely. This type of interaction gave us insight into the problem of needing
    a way to record your experiences and thoughts while you watch instead of afterwards, and
    inspired our design for directly transcribing your notes into the app for later use.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### There is a Movie Discussion Flow

{/* maxHeight={"400px"} */}
    One important insight we gained in our design research was the distinction in phases between
    how participants create their notes (either mentally or physically) , how they conceptualize
    and summarize the notes, and finally how they discuss them with others. This was a consistent
    pattern between all participants that emerged, and inspired our app flow of Record -> Summarize
    -> Review.

            caption: "Receive the sent notes on your phone app.",

### Taking Notes is Awkward
{/* maxHeight={"400px"} */}
<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: textimage5, //
        alt: "A photo of people talking in a movie theater and the ReelTalk recording screen"
    }}
    caption={
        "Don't be disruptive! Use ReelTalk!"
    }
    width={6}
>

    From our interview results it quickly became clear that taking notes in a theater or at home
    with your phone, or writing down paper notes with friends around is uncommon and awkward
    especially if others are around. Additionally, the avid and casual movie viewers stated that
    looking down to take notes interrupts the experience of watching a movie, and can lead to missing
    what is currently happening. This insight helped us to decide on a smartwatch interface to deliver
    our note recording/summarizing functionality as seamlessly as possible. Specifically, this design
    is intended to be as if you are whispering your thoughts to a friend!

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

Our design focused on two tasks: highlighting key points of a movie during viewing and
    summarizing notes into an easily accessible guide for leading conversations about memorable
    movie moments. We created paper prototypes for a smartwatch application and a phone application,
    designed to work together. These prototypes underwent multiple rounds of inspection, heuristic
    evaluation, and usability testing with students in CSE 440, who were instructed to imagine
    themselves in a movie theater. We chose these participants because our initial research
    participants were unavailable, and students in CSE 440 were more accessible. We realize that
    this environment isn't completely accurate compared to that of an actual movie theater. However,
    they were not willing to commit time to go to a movie theater and watch an entire movie during
    testing, hence being asked to “imagine.” Also, our paper prototype compared to a digital
    smartwatch screen wouldn't be visible in a dark movie theater. Overall, our choice of participants
    and their environment was based on convenience within a limited time frame, but our process still
    provided valuable insights into user preferences and needs while addressing the challenge of
    participant availability.

### Adding Key Details for App Utilization

{/*<ProjectImageBlock

        }}
        caption={
            "Initial: No prompts for help or instructions for new users."
        } 
        width={4}
        maxHeight={300}
> */}

 During user testing, it became evident that participants faced challenges in utilizing the app
    due to incomplete information, impeding their navigation and task completion. Users voiced
    confusion regarding certain features and their functionalities, prompting a need for clearer
    guidance. For example, one participant asked about what the purpose of saving notes was after
    recording an audio note. In response, we refined the design by integrating comprehensive
    context-based explanations and instructions across the interface, along with optional help
    buttons, aiming to equip users with the essential information needed for effective interaction.
    This iterative process, driven by user feedback, sought to bridge the information gap and
    enhance overall user experience by facilitating informed navigation and utilization of the app's
    features.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: initial_help,
            alt: "Paper prototype with no help for a new user",
            caption: "Initial: No prompts for help or instructions for new users."
        },
        {
            src: updated_help_0,
            alt: "Updated digital prototype with help prompts",
            caption: "Updated: Added a question mark (help) button in the top right corner of most screens so a user could quickly access context-based instructions if they were confused."
        },
        {
            src: updated_help_1,
            alt: "Updated digital prototype with help prompts",
            caption: "Updated: Added a popup to view instructions upon launching the app for first-time users, or anyone needing a refresher on how to use the app."

### Enhancing Clarity and Learning

{/* maxHeight={"400px"} */}
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: initial_notes,
            alt: "Initial notes",
            caption: "Initial: No back buttons."
        },
        {
            src: updated_notes,
            alt: "Updated notes",
            caption: "Updated: Added back buttons so a user could choose to go back to their initial screen after navigating to a screen."
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"225px"}
>

    User testing unveiled significant navigation hurdles and unpredictable user behavior, revealing
    a mismatch between expected interaction flows and actual user experiences. Participants grappled
    with the absence of intuitive cues, such back buttons or help buttons, and expressed frustration
    with the linear design structure. 
    
    Consequently, we introduced these features to enhance clarity
    and alleviate the steep learning curve. Furthermore, we pivoted from a rigid, linear layout to a
    more adaptable framework to accommodate non-linear interactions, informed by specific participant
    feedback. These iterative adjustments aimed to align the design with user expectations, ensuring
    a smoother and more engaging user experience.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Fixing a Confusing User Flow Between SmartWatch and Phone

{/* maxHeight={"400px"} */}
    One unique challenge of our design was that it consists of two parts: the smartwatch app and
    the phone app. This meant that there needed to be clear indications on when to use each part of
    the design, and when to switch over between the two devices. 
    
    For our first usability test, we
    were so clear-set on a singular flow for our design that we gave only the smartwatch to the
    participant at first, then gave them the smartphone part of the prototype later. Even with this
    mistake, with no indications on when information got sent over from the smartwatch to the phone
    app, the participant told us that it was unclear when to use each part of the design, and
    expressed surprise that there was a phone app that goes with the smartwatch. 
    
    With that comment,
    we improved our usability testing structure and for future tests, we gave the participant both
    the smartwatch and the phone at the start. We were then able to improve upon which parts of the
    task in particular was difficult to understand from a user's perspective. 
    
    To improve our design,
    we made it clear that the phone wasn't supposed to be used at the start by including a screen for
    the base state. We also added system dialogue to clarify when information gets sent from the
    smartwatch to the phone app, and added popups on the phone app to indicate when it was time to
    switch to the phone app.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: initial_flow_1,

        },

            alt: "Updated flow 1",
            caption: "Updated: Added a popup so users know exactly when information got moved from the smartwatch to the phone."
        },

## Resulting Design

The critical aspects of our design facilitate user ease in achieving our two primary tasks:
highlighting key points of a movie during viewing and summarizing notes into an easily accessible
guide for leading conversations about memorable movie moments.
