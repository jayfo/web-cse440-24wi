## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

In an era where rapid online communication is vital, it's surprisingly easy to overlook replying to messages.
Studies reveal that while 50% of electronic replies occur within an hour, the remainder can extend to days,
leading to unintentional neglect. In the case of loved ones and close friends this can then start to
strain relationships. Our project, Mindful Messenger, aims to address this issue by helping users
become more aware of their response times, thereby improving their communication habits and reducing the stress
of digital interactions.

## Design Research Process

### Unraveling Texting Habits: A Study at the University of Washington

We embarked on a comprehensive study involving interviews and surveys with computer science students, aiming to delve
into the underlying reasons behind poor texting habits. This approach provided both qualitative insights from interviews
and quantitative data from surveys, helping to validate initial observations and uncover patterns in texting behavior.

Our four participants for the interviews were all Computer Science majors at the University of Washington. All of our participants 
are taking a higher workload, consisting of about 16-18 credits, and are involved in a variety of extracurricular activities and jobs
 such as on-campus organizations, teaching assistant roles, and research. Our participants varied in their perception of their text 
 response speeds and also differed in opinion regarding the correlation between their busy workloads and text response levels. 
 Overall, they demonstrated interest in the project concept as a whole and agreed that this is a relevant problem sphere to explore.
The survey participants came from the same demographic background as the four previously described interview participants. We posted
 the survey on Instagram and also asked specifically via word of mouth and text to known Computer Science students. The survey aimed 
 to achieve a wider pool of data at a more quantitative level, enabling us to draw patterns that help validate initial insights 
 gathered from our interviews.

### Key Insights

#### Understanding Response Times

Through our participant interviews, we found that there are several factors that influence someone's response time:

1. *Urgency* - We found that the urgency of the message was the biggest factor in determining response time. Two of our participants mentioned prioritizing responses if the texts were about making plans.
2. *Location* - We found that our participants would catch up on texting people back in certain locations, from work bathrooms and public transport to home.
3. *Who's Texting* - Our participants had diverse answers for who they prioritize. One of our participants prioritized responding to close friends and family, while another prioritized responding quickly to new acquaintances. Regardless, all of our participants prioritized responding quickly to a select few people.
4. *Messaging Platform* - All participants we interviewed primarily used one messaging platform such as iMessage or WhatsApp, where they prioritized responding to the most, while not so much prioritizing other platforms such as Discord, Instagram, or Snapchat.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
      src: infographic,
      alt: "Hours worked per week vs. response time. Hours worked has no significant effect on response time."
    }}

    width={6}
>
Surprisingly, through our survey results, how busy someone was had little effect on their texting habits or response
time. The majority of participants had a response time of less than 5 hours, and those who had a much longer response
time weren't working more hours or taking more credits than average.
</ProjectImageBlock>

#### Diverse Reactions to Response Times

When participants were asked in a survey "How does being on the receiving end of slower response
times make you feel?" responses varied greatly:

* "If it's something urgent, I feel frustrated. If it's something not so urgent but I sent it to a close friend, I might feel a little irritated. If it's just an acquaintance and the content of the message isn't important, I don't really care."
* "If it's someone i'm super close to i don't care, but if not then not the best."
* "I don't mind that much usually, but from certain people it does make me feel bad."

We found that participants feel anxiety over slow response times if the message content is important, or if they are messaging
someone important. This expressed a need for our app to distinguish urgent messages and also allow people to track response times
with certain people individually.

#### Technology as an Aid

Some participants utilized message tracking features in their apps, highlighting a need for more sophisticated
solutions. For instance, one of our participants used the Google Pixel's native message app's functionality to keep
track of people they needed to respond to, as people they need to follow-up on float to the top of their messages list.

## Iterative Design Process

### Design Focus

We wanted to design an app that allows students to be mindful about response times and maintain meaningful connections
with friends and family through text. We found the best way to execute this was through mobile integration, since it
supports both of our tasks well and our app will be in close proximity to where students communicate via text. The
primary tasks our app supports are:

1. Tracking message response times in a conversation with a new acquaintance.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
      src: task1,
      alt: "Navigate to contacts page and click the plus sign to add a contact. Fill in name and phone number, press continue, and set reminders to add a contact. Now on the contacts page, view text conversation analytics by clicking their contact card."
    }}

    width={12}
/>

2. Getting advice for specific responses to a difficult conversation topic.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
      src: task2,
      alt: "Navigate to replies page and click on the reply we want to generate a response for. Click generate, then click refresh until the desired response is generated. Then click send."
    }}

    width={12}
/>

### Process

We drafted our initial design on a paper prototype. We performed multiple iterations of heuristic analysis and usability testing.
Our design was tested by three Allen School students or graduates, where we identified key issues with design heuristics,
iterating on our paper prototype until we arrived at our final digital mockup.

### Key Insights

#### Streamlined Bulk Usability

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
      src: bulkadd,
      alt: "Contact multi-select feature. Users can select multiple contacts."
    }}

    width={3}
>
During the initial rounds of the paper prototype testing process, our participants posed the question:
How can I add multiple contacts? This lack of functionality in our feature space was hugely overlooked during
our rapid design process, and this realization drove the development of a significant amount of new pages and
components that leaned into the flexibility and efficiency of use heuristics. Additionally, during the second
round of paper prototype usability testing, a similar idea was mentioned that individually customizing the
reminder setting thresholds for each new contact would be inefficient. From this, we added our bulk select,
group reminder setting editing, and editing features that are pieces of functionality that are now core to our design.
</ProjectImageBlock>

{/* <img src="/images/projects/messageminder/post/bulkadd.png" alt="Contacts edit" style={{ width: "25%" }} /> */}


#### Clarity of the Reply Space

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
      src: reply_screen,
      alt: "List of replies to respond to. Urgent text messages are at the top."
    }}

    width={3}
>
Another uncovered aspect when conducting the second round of paper prototype testing was a lack of clarity
in how one can access and view existing messages that are in need of responses. One of our participants voiced
confusion about where the actual response generation button was, and also how to even navigate to the specific
message in the first place. Initially, we only had four main app page tabs, yet after careful ideation when
iterating our design into the digital mockup form, we realized that adding another page that housed solely the
replies created a stronger clarity towards the reply generation feature for users.
</ProjectImageBlock>

{/* <img src="/images/projects/messageminder/post/reply_screeen.png" alt="Key Findings Infographic" style={{ width: "25%" }} /> */}


#### Technology Context Integration

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
      src: response_generated,
      alt: "Response generation feature. Generates a suggested response based on user input."
    }}

    width={3}
>
We were solely focused on developing the reply generation process during our initial iterations that we overlooked
the notion that our users may simply need an opportunity to navigate from a reply message into the native messaging
application. This "Go To Message" functionality in conjunction with the core generation feature was a suggestion
that one of our paper prototype usability testing participants suggested, and it felt like such a clear and meaningful
addition to our design. This idea leans into the notion of MessageMinder functioning more as a tool that empowers
users to navigate to responding to messages at a consistent level, and it was interesting to discover how we
overlooked this core idea in our initial design.

## Resulting Design



### MessageMinder: A Tool for Effective Digital Communication

Our final design includes two key tasks:

- **Feature 1 (Mobile)**: Tracking message response times in a conversation with a new acquaintance.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: overview,
            alt: "Overview page. Summary of analytics and messages to respond to.",
        },
        {
            src: contact,
            alt: "List of contacts page. Favorite contacts are starred.",
        },
        {
            src: add_new,
            alt: "Add new contact page. Enter name and phone number.",
        },
        {
            src: set_reminder,
            alt: "Set reminders for new contact. Enter reminder time and vibrate and sound patterns.",
        },
        {
            src: tim_vo_reminder,
            alt: "Contact-specific analytics and overview page.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "These images show the workflow of task 1. A User can go from the homepage to the contact list, add a new contact, set reminders for that contact, and view contact-specific analytics."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"275px"}
>

Users are able to view a dashboard of their analytics and set goals for their response times. The app will then track their progress and provide reminders to respond to messages.
As we see in the images, the user can first view their dashboard, click on the analytics widget to track their stats. They can then choose to add a contact.
After adding a contact they can then configure a reminder for that contact and then view their analytics with that person. 
</ProjectImagesBlock>

- **Feature 2 (Mobile)**: Automated advice for crafting appropriate responses in complex conversations.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: reply_screen,
            alt: "List of replies to respond to. Urgent text messages are at the top.",
        },
        {
            src: generate_reply,
            alt: "Response generation feature. Select a reply to generate a response.",
        },
        {
            src: response_generated,
            alt: "Response generation feature. Generates a suggested response based on user input.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "These images depict task 2. A user can view the conversation they want to respond to, click on the reply button, see what type of response they want to use, and then generate a response to that conversation. If they don't like it they can refresh until they are satisfied."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

Oftentimes users do not want to respond since the conversation requires too much thinking activation power to overcome. This
task is designed to enable users to generate a response to a difficult conversation topic. As we see in the images to the right,
users can view the conversation they want to respond to, click on the reply button, see what type of response they want to use, and then
generate a response to that conversation. If they don't like it they can refresh until they are satisfied.
