## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Baking, while therapeutic for many, can also be a source of frustration and anxiety due to its demanding requirements 
of precision and the need for proper tools. This dichotomy highlights the critical role of community support in the baking 
journey. Recognizing this need, there arises a constant demand for a flexible learning platform tailored to bakers of all 
skill levels, aimed at fostering personalized skill development in the art of baking.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,

Enter BakeSmart - a comprehensive solution in the form of an app – designed to address the challenges faced by the baking community. 
Through extensive research and interviews, our team identified a significant gap: the absence of a unified platform that seamlessly 
integrates personal skill development and community building. BakeSmart fills this void by providing bakers with a space to chart 
their journey towards success while fostering connections with peers. By offering a wide range of functionalities, 
BakeSmart encourages individuals to embark on their baking journey or nurture novice bakers, 
ensuring that the passion for baking thrives under the guidance of professionals.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

The overall goal of our design research is better understanding the baking processes among bakers, 
focusing on how our project can help bridge the gap between them, ultimately demystifying the complexities 
of baking. Our research method involves conducting interviews with bakers of different skill levels, and 
baking observations with novice bakers. Thus, our participants include:
- Beth, a professional baker with 10+ years of experience.
- Baljeet, Bailey, and Bjorn, novice bakers with 2-3 years of experience.
- Brent, a non-baker with no experience.

Researching among the variety of bakers allows us to compare the likeness and difference of the baking process 
between bakers. In addition, the interviews let us examine the unique perspectives and consider the diverse 
needs and expectations of our intended users. By directly observing the novice bakers, we can gain a 
comprehensive understanding of their behaviors and thought process in the act of baking. Through our design 
research, we have found the overarching themes to be centered around the need for a structured approach to 
baking for novices, inspired by the methodologies of professional bakers to bridge the gap between novices and 
professionals. Novices would benefit from a community to discuss outcomes and user-friendly ways to record their 
baking sessions, which could accelerate their learning curve. We found three key insights that could provide novice 
bakers the proper structure to aid their journey to baking expertise.

            alt: "",
            caption: "Initial design idea: A methodical approach where user gets to record 
                      themselves & compare their videos with a professional one and based 
                      on their self ratings, they get to go through a progression tree.",
        },

### The Methodical Approach

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8004,
        alt: "Initial design idea: A methodical approach where user gets to record themselves, compare their videos with a professional one, and based on their self ratings, they get to go through a progression tree.",
    }}
    caption={

    }
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Echoing the discipline of professional bakers, there is an urgent need for novices to adopt, 
or have access to a platform that offers, a more methodical approach to their baking endeavors.
It includes having step by step guidance, the small details that professionals follow but somehow
overlooked by novices, and a gamified approach to make the process enjoyable. The interviewees 
expressed a significant need of building something that would keep them encouraged to continue 
in the long run. To ensure this, we initiated an approach where user can compare their every 
progress and can compare it with a professional one.

### User-Friendly Documentation

The path to perfection is paved with the notes of past experiments. 
Facilitating a user-friendly way to document (and easily review) their baking process 
will empower novices to find their way to success. We decided to have more usability & accessibility for 
people from all across the world and non tech savvy backgrounds through incorporating more common used icons
instead of just relying on a lot of writings. And for recipes having a voice over option to help the users
in various ways.

    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder400x4002,

            caption: "Initial design idea: User friendly documentation on the interface with more usage of commonly used icons of videos, mood board, and notes.",

        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>




</ProjectImagesBlock>

### The Power of Community

Novices are in dire need of a baking community where they can share, learn, and grow – a digital 
'sourdough starter', if you will. Within this community, novices can seek advice from professionals, 
while professionals could gain fresh new perspectives from novices, such as learning a new recipe from 
a different culture, thus elevating the baking experience for all through reciprocal exchange.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

From our design research process, we narrowed our design focus down to two key tasks 
that our design aims to accomplish: Choosing a Recipe from baking skills or a baking 
quest, and Baking and Refining a Recipe. To start our iterative design process, we 
created a paper prototype that went through heuristic inspection and usability testing. 
From these tests, we found that our participants thought positively of the methodical 
approach, the availability of community, and the ease of documentation presented in 
our design. However, from these three insights found from our design research, our 
participants were left wanting clarity from some of them or a greater emphasis on 
them from others. The feedback received from our participants lead us to three key 
insights we improved on: Linear Baking Quest, Accessibility towards Community 
Engagement, and Simple Recipe Editing Process.

### Linear Baking Quest

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8001,
        alt: "We have gradually improved from confusing tree progression to linear progression that locks the previous progress levels as the user finishes it.",
    }}
    caption={
        "We have gradually improved from confusing tree progression to linear progression that locks the previous progress levels as the user finishes it."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Prior to the development of the linear baking quest, our design had a non-linear web 
design for our baking quest. During the heuristic test, our participant found that the
web design may be “too confusing” and had potential visibility problems, violating the 
multiple heuristics but notably, 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design. In our revised paper 
prototype and later our digital design, we switched to a linear quest approach commonly seen 
in other mobile educational applications, improving the usability of the design.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Accessibility towards Community Engagement

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8003,
        alt: "Our community page before usability testing (on paper) and after testing (digital version)",
    }}
    caption={
        "Our community page before usability testing (on paper) and after testing (digital version)."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Prior to implementing greater accessibility to our community page, our design only 
had a few places that could access the community tab. During a usability test, our 
participant found that the community tab seemed like an “essential component” of our 
design and wanted easier access to the page with direct interaction on a certain 
recipe. For this reason, we included obvious accessibility to our community engagement
page that would link to a discussion board on the recipe the baker just made.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### A More Complete Recipe Editing Process

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x8002,
        alt: "Final paper prototype that shows how users can get help from community experts and refine their recipe!",
    }}
    caption={
        "Final paper prototype that shows how users can get help from community experts and refine their recipe!"
    }
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Prior to implementing a simple recipe editing process, our design simply let bakers 
give a rating to a recipe that could lead to editing. During our heuristic evaluation 
and usability tests,  our participants did not find the editing buttons during the 
feedback process and gave feedback that they were unsure whether the feedback was for 
themselves or the recipe. This implies that the intention of these pages could be unclear 
to potential bakers. We revamped the feedback process to include both feedback for the 
recipe and a personal rating with the ability to comment for both and clear buttons 
for the editing in our digital design.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Resulting Design

The latest iteration of our digital interface reveals a user-centric design that streamlines the 
culinary journey, featuring a linear baking quest path to enhance navigation and engagement. 
The revamped interface includes a nuanced star rating system for recipe complexity, allowing users 
to intuitively select recipes that match their skill level, as showcased in the visuals. 
The user experience is elevated through a simplified feedback process, enabling bakers to provide and
view responses with ease, as illustrated in the accompanying images.

>

**1A: Choosing a Recipe from a Baking Skill:** 

The user journey begins with selecting "Work A Skill" on the first screen [shown in the very top picture], 
leading to a scrollable list of baking skills with a search function. Users can choose 
multiple skills, and upon confirmation with a green checkmark, they're directed to a list 
of matching recipes, sorted by popularity. These recipes can be further refined by difficulty 
using star ratings. Each recipe offers options to view a video tutorial or user-submitted 
photos. Selecting a recipe takes the user to a detailed step-by-step guide, with an option 
to view the recipe overview at any time. Progression through the recipe steps is managed by 
clicking "finish" after each step.

**1B: Choosing a Recipe from a Baking Quest:**

Selecting "Baking Quest" offers users options to 'Continue Quest', 'Start New Quest', or 'See Quest History'. 
Choosing to continue, they're shown a scrollable list with their goal recipe at the top and subsequent 
recipes listed in recommended order. Selecting a recipe reveals a progress map highlighting the goal and 
any prerequisites. A further click provides recipe details similar to Task 1A, leading directly into the 
first step of the recipe.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder600x3001,
        alt: "Task 1B: Digital mockup of what happens when a user chooses a recipe from baking quest.",

### Task 2: Baking and Refining a Recipe

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder600x3004,

        "Task 2A: User starts baking and they have different assistant tools for perfect measurement, temperature etc."
    }
    width={7.5}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>
**2A: Baking a Recipe:**
As the user starts one of the recipes of their choice, they are guided through each step and only 
proceed to the next one after completing the previous one. For example, if the first step is measuring, 
the pop up button will remain on until the user clicks on the button – and gets proceeded to the next step. 
The user would also have the option to go to one of the previous steps by hitting the back arrow button in 
the upper-left corner. Each of the steps would have it’s own integral functionality like having smart tools 
integrated with the measure step and also there will be a timer pop up when something is baking. Once the user 
has finished all the steps, they get to the DONE! Page and has the option to connect to a community and give 
feedback.

</ProjectImageBlock>

**2B: Refining a Recipe:**
When a user clicks on the Ingredient or Step button, it takes them to a 
separate screen that shows the specific steps or ingredients needed for the recipe.
The step button allows the user a specific step they wish to edit, and lets them to document the changes and 
leave a reasoning as to why they wish to change the recipe step in the form of notes.
The Ingredient button lets them edit the ingredients list, document changes and leave constructive 
feedback. Once a user finishes editing the ingredients, it will take them back to 
the Step or Ingredient tab, where it now shows the modified step or ingredients list, as well as 
a note tab that shows the user feedback.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x3005,
            alt: "Task 2B: Users get to refine a step in their recipe or ingredient according to their own suggestions!",
            caption: "Task 2B: Users get to refine a step in their recipe or ingredient according to their own suggestions!"
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder600x3003,
            alt: "Task 2B: Users get to connect with community and refine the recipes according to the suggestions!",

        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={13}
    maxHeight={"300px"}

</ProjectImagesBlock>

In the refined feedback section, bakers can now gauge their performance alongside the recipe's 
effectiveness, supported by a dual-rating system captured in the screenshots. This allows for targeted
enhancements and fosters a community-centric approach to culinary mastery. The inclusion of a digital
scale interface, as depicted, integrates technology with traditional baking, offering precision and 
efficiency. Altogether, these digital advancements form a comprehensive baking assistant, enriching 
the connection between the baker and the broader cooking community.
