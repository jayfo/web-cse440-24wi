## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Long distance relationships, everyone has heard about them, experienced them, 
or seen a depiction of them. But in college, a lot of people are forced 
to navigate the newfound distance between them and their parents for 
the first time. However, only roughly 41% of college students communicate 
with their parents daily. This can take a toll on parent-child relationships 
and cause strain on relationships that are navigating this new distance. 

That’s where OrcaPod comes into play. OrcaPod allows participants to 
track multiple conversations with a person’s parent or children 
across multiple time zones. In turn, this allows participants to keep 
their parent or child involved in their lives even while apart. OrcaPod 
provides an interactive and creative way for parents and children to 
stay connected even if they may not be able to physically see each other.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

When designing our solution, we focused on three main things during the 
research process: problems, reasons, and solutions. In a more in-depth 
approach, identifying issues that lead to a lack of communication between 
a parent and child, reasons for the lack of communication, and potential 
solutions to fix the communication gap. 

People have different reasons and issues that come up when it comes to 
keeping their parent or child involved in their lives. For example, an 
international student might struggle to keep their parents involved in 
their life because of the difference in time zone or a student could be 
in the middle of exams and don’t have the mental or physical capacity to 
communicate with their parent(s) at the time. Similarly, how we then attempt 
to solve these issues needs to match the motivations of both parents and their 
children, or else we risk creating a one-sided or worse, a solution nobody wants.

For our design research, we chose to do three interviews because this 
allowed us to have an in-depth conversation with people in our stakeholder 
groups and narrow down our problem space. During our interviews, we asked 
the participants multiple questions relating to their communications with 
their parents or children from whom they live away from. For example, we 
explored the reasons why some of the participants tend to neglect communicating 
with their parents or children and their daily schedules which leads to a 
lack of communication. 

We chose to focus on international college students, students who live away 
from home, and parents of students away from home. This gave us a dual problem 
approach to navigating how to bridge communication issues between parents and 
students who live away from home.

### Technological Knowledge Differences

During our interview with the student who lived away from home in Washington, 
we learned that they didn’t favor using complicated apps to communicate with 
their parents while they lived away from home because their parents had a limited 
understanding of technology. 

### Lack of Emotions and Depth when Texting

From our interview with the international student, we found out that they struggled 
with fully expressing their emotions through texts and wished for a better way to 
communicate their thoughts and emotions with their parents from across the world. 

{/* </ProjectImagesBlock> */}

### Holidays and Traditions at the Core of Some Family Dynamics

In our interview with the parent and the student living away from home in Washington, 
they expressed a desire for wanting to continue ethnic traditions and holidays with 
their parents. Both participants wanted to find ways to continue getting together with 
their families to celebrate these holidays and traditions or find a way to celebrate 
virtually when they couldn’t. 

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{

    caption={

    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"800px"}

Our design focus was primarily on enhancing user interaction with a smartboard, specifically 
by improving communication across different time zones and ensuring clear communication when 
one party is unavailable. Our iterative design process started with creating an initial paper 
prototype of our smartboard. We then ran a heuristics evaluation with another group in CSE 440 
to identify and resolve heuristic violations. Next, we conducted three usability tests with three 
different participants. Our participants consisted of an international student living in off-campus 
housing, a student living away from home in off-campus housing, and a parent of a student who lived 
away from home when they were at college for a bit. We chose these participants because the parent had 
extremely limited knowledge and familiarity with technology while the college students were able to 
offer insight as people who were familiar with smartboards and technology. We began each test with 
a summary of our project, design, and explained the two tasks. Then we had participants attempt to 
complete both tasks with the paper prototype. From these usability tests, we identified multiple 
issues with our design and workflow, as discussed below.

### Favorability Within Modes in Different Demographics

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: byransPod,
            alt: "The pod screen Bryan sees for Elizabeth",
            caption: "Bryan is a young participant communicating with their parent, Elizabeth.",
        },
        {
            src: elizasPod,
            alt: "The pod screen Elizabeth sees Bryan.",
            caption: "Elizabeth is an older participant communicating with their child, Bryan.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Based on the first and second usability tests, we found that younger participants prefer touch 
functionality, while older participants favor stylus functionality when using 
the smartboard or tablet. Additionally, younger users prefer using a keyboard to 
input text, whereas older participants prefer a combination of writing and voice 
features for text input.

### Need for Organization and Navigation

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: fppGridlines,
            alt: "Final paper prototype gridlines",
            caption: "Final paper prototype added gridlines to assist with participant's navigations.",
        },
        {
            src: digitalGridlines,
            alt: "The pod screen Elizabeth sees for Ashley.",
            caption: "Digital prototype added gridbox to assist with participant's navigation.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"800px"}
>

Across all our usability tests, participants often lacked guidance on what actions to take. 
There were many questions regarding the functions and meanings of various buttons on 
our smartboard. Our design offered too much freedom and caused participants to become 
lost and struggle with navigation. Allowing participants to input anything on the 
smart board also resulted in too much clutter and confusion on the screen, making it 
harder to use.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Error Prevention & Option to Undo

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: fppError,
            alt: "Final paper prototype for error and prevention",
            caption: "Final paper prototype added a way for the participant to hide/show, blur/unblur, and delete messages.",
        },
        {
            src: digitalError,
            alt: "Digital mock up for error and prevention.",
            caption: "In addition to what has already been added in the final paper prototype, " + 
            "the digital mock up added a way for the participant to edit their messages.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During our third usability test there were moments we discovered where the participants 
entered unexpected numbers or words because our design lacked restrictions on input. 
We lacked a method to undo these messages, which meant they remained permanently on 
the smartboard, and this took away from the participant's experience.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

## Resulting Design

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: finalDesign,
            alt: "A white board with four yellowing boxes highlighting different aspects of the board.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "During our design we had numerous iterations. Here we showcase the board's ability to " 
        + "hide, blur, or delete messages, switch between connected boards easily, allow users to use " 
        + "a prefer messagae sending type, and provide guidance on where to write messages."
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our resulting design for the OrcaPod Board consisted of a 72”x40” wall-hung smartboard with 
a built-in microphone and speaker. The microphone and speaker work in tandem for the voice 
recording and voice messages that people can send with the board. With this application 
parents and children can keep each other involved in their lives by helping people avoid 
manually converting time zones and giving them time and space to communicate at their leisure 
instead of always being connected in what could be stressful times. The participant can use the 
board to establish a pattern of when people are awake and able to communicate instead of constantly 
guessing.

            caption: "After the alarm is set, the parent can continue with their day until the alarm "

Here our two participants, named Elizabeth and Ashley for convenience, Elizabeth wants to set 
an alarm that will notify them when Ashley’s time zone has reached 8 AM. Since they know that 
Ashley is up at that time and will be able to talk.

The participant goes through the set-up phase and sets their desired time and duration for 
the other party. Once that has been finalized, they click "Finish."

Afterward, we arrive at the home page and proceed to the smartboard interface by tapping or 
clicking the respective folder.

Once the time has struck, the participant will click on the box or push the flag down to 
make the notification disappear. After acknowledging that they've seen the alert, the 
participant will then proceed to write a message by tapping or using the stylus anywhere 
on the board.

A keyboard screen will pop up near where the participant taps and can have the option to 
write, type, or vocalize their message. Once confirmed, the participant can tap or click 
"Finish" to finalize their message.

Once the message has been sent, they will have the option to delete, hide, or blur their 
message by tapping the option below it. Once finalized, the other party can see the message 
and reply accordingly.

Bryan is struggling with balancing midterms and keeping Elizabeth involved in their life at the moment. 

The participant goes through the set-up phase and once everything has been finalized, 
they click "Finish” and arrive at the home page. Once at the home page, we can proceed to the 
smartboard interface by tapping or clicking the folder. The participant will see a new message 
indicating that the other party may not be available and push the flag down, click, or tap the box 
to remove their notification.

Then the participant can write their message by tapping or using the stylus anywhere on the board. 
A keyboard screen will pop up near where the participant taps and can have the option to write, type, 
or vocalize their message. Once confirmed, the participant can tap or click "Finish" to finalize their 
message.

Once the message has been posted, the participant has the option to hide, blur, 
or delete their message, and the other party will receive a notification on their board.
